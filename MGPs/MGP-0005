## Overview

The Validator Committee is responsible for block proposing during each epoch. The current number of validators in Committee is 35 at the moment. 

## Motivation

There are 35 validators will be elected during each epoch to participate in block signing. Since MAPO ecosystem is getting bigger, there are more valuable and strong partners joining as validators to support the ecosystem. Hence, the team is proposing to add more validators to the committee during election. In order to satisfy MAPO security standard, the new MGP-0005 is going to add 5 spots for new validators to join the consensus process.

## Specification

The parameter involved with the change is 

```solidity
   struct ElectableValidators {
        uint256 min;
        uint256 max;
    }
```

 The function that set the change is 

```solidity
    function setElectableValidators(uint256 min, uint256 max) public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        require(0 < min, "Minimum electable validators cannot be zero");
        require(min <= max, "Maximum electable validators cannot be smaller than minimum");
        require(
            min != electableValidators.min || max != electableValidators.max,
            "Electable validators not changed"
        );
        electableValidators = ElectableValidators(min, max);
        emit ElectableValidatorsSet(min, max);
        return true;
    }
```



The proposed change to the function is 

```solidity
min = 1;
max = 40;
```

which means that there are 40 validators elected during an epoch.

## Implementation

The modification of the validator committee number will be in

## Security Considerations
