## Background

As MAP Protocol continues to expand its omnichain infrastructure, liquidity depth and cross-chain capital efficiency have become increasingly critical to ecosystem growth.

Currently, limited liquidity access across chains can constrain:

* Cross-chain trading activity
* User participation and retention
* Capital inflows into the MAP ecosystem

To address these challenges, the MAP Protocol Foundation proposes a full opening of liquidity provision across supported chains. This initiative is designed to attract broader participation from liquidity providers (LPs), improve cross-chain liquidity availability, and significantly increase overall trading volume.

By lowering barriers to entry and introducing competitive, usage-oriented incentives, this proposal aims to strengthen MAP Protocol’s position as a high-liquidity, high-efficiency omnichain infrastructure layer.

## Proposal Details

The MAP Protocol Foundation proposes to fully open liquidity provision across supported chains, with the following components:

1. Open Access to Liquidity Provision

* Liquidity pools will be opened to all eligible users without restrictive caps or whitelist limitations.

* Participants will be able to freely add liquidity across supported cross-chain markets within the MAP ecosystem.

* This open-access model is intended to encourage broader community participation and deeper liquidity formation.

2. Incentive Mechanism (APY)

* An initial target APY of up to approximately 66.04% will be used as a liquidity bootstrapping reference to attract early participation and accelerate cross-chain trading activity.

* Rewards will be distributed in $USDT, calculated based on liquidity contribution and participation duration.

* APY levels are not fixed and may be dynamically adjusted over time based on:

  - Liquidity depth
  - Cross-chain trading volume
  - Protocol revenue and sustainability considerations

* Any significant adjustments to incentive parameters will remain transparent and subject to governance oversight.

3. Cross-Chain Liquidity Enhancement

* Liquidity provided through this initiative will directly support:

    - Cross-chain swaps

    - Omnichain asset transfers

    - Multi-network trading activity

* Improved liquidity depth is expected to:

    - Reduce slippage

    - Improve price efficiency

    - Enhance overall user trading experience across supported chains

4. Funding Source

* Liquidity incentives will be funded primarily through governance-approved ecosystem incentive allocations and reward pools.

* All reward emissions and distributions will be:

    - Transparent

    - Publicly verifiable

    - Tracked on-chain

5. Governance and Transparency

* All liquidity pools, reward emissions, and APY parameters will be publicly visible and verifiable on-chain.

* The community, through DAO governance, may participate in decisions related to:

    - APY adjustments

    - Reward duration and emission levels

    - Liquidity pool expansions or optimizations

* This ensures that liquidity incentives evolve in line with real protocol usage and long-term sustainability.

6. Risk Notice

* Market conditions, liquidity performance, protocol security considerations, and operational factors may impact execution.

* If required to protect the long-term health and security of the ecosystem, the MAP Protocol Foundation may propose adjustments, pauses, or termination of this initiative, with timely disclosure to the community and governance where applicable.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Increased Cross-Chain Liquidity

Opening liquidity provision with competitive incentives is expected to attract additional capital into the MAP ecosystem, strengthening cross-chain liquidity depth.

2. Higher Trading Volume

Deeper liquidity and reduced slippage are expected to encourage more frequent and larger cross-chain trades, increasing overall protocol transaction volume.

3. Ecosystem Growth and Adoption

Improved liquidity conditions enhance user experience, attract new users and partners, and support sustainable long-term ecosystem expansion.

## Conclusion

The MAP Protocol Foundation believes that fully opening liquidity provision is a strategic step toward accelerating cross-chain adoption and trading activity.

By:

* Enabling open participation

* Introducing an attractive but adjustable initial APY reference

* Maintaining transparent, governance-driven incentive management

this proposal aims to build a more liquid, efficient, and competitive omnichain ecosystem for all MAPO stakeholders.

This initiative reflects MAP Protocol’s long-term commitment to scalability, openness, and sustainable growth driven by real usage.
