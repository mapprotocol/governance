## Overview

The proposal aims to enhance the long-term value and scarcity of the MAPO token by implementing a strategic buyback and burn mechanism.

## Specification

Key Components:

## Buyback Mechanism

A portion of protocol profits or transaction fees will be allocated for purchasing MAPO tokens from the open market.

## Burn Mechanism

After the buyback, the acquired MAPO tokens will be permanently removed from circulation by sending them to a burn address. 
This reduces the overall token supply.

## Funding Source

Protocol revenues (transaction fees, etc.).

Buybacks and burns may often occur, depending on protocol revenue.

## Governance and Transparency

All buyback and burn transactions will be publicly recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

The community may participate in governance decisions regarding the percentage of profits allocated for this purpose.

Transparent buyback and burn practices can boost community trust and confidence in the ecosystem.What is your opinion?

## Security Considerations

None.
