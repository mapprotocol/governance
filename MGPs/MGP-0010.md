## Background

MAP Protocol enables secure and efficient cross-chain asset transfers through a decentralized liquidity network. The current fee structure was designed to support network security, liquidity providers, and long-term protocol sustainability.

As MAP Protocol continues to expand its cross-chain integrations and usage scenarios, optimizing transaction costs becomes increasingly important to remain competitive and to unlock greater on-chain activity.

## Overview

This proposal suggests reducing MAP Protocol’s Protocol Fee and Vault Fee to 0.01% respectively.
The goal is to encourage higher transaction volume, improve liquidity utilization across vaults, and enhance overall network activity while maintaining sustainable protocol economics.

## Purpose

The purpose for this proposal is to:

Reduce friction for users and integrators executing cross-chain transactions

Encourage higher transaction frequency and protocol usage

Improve capital efficiency by increasing vault liquidity utilization

Strengthen MAP Protocol’s position as a cost-efficient cross-chain infrastructure

Lower fees are expected to attract more organic usage and better leverage existing liquidity without changing the core protocol design.

## Proposal Details

This proposal recommends adjusting the following fee parameters:

| Fee Type |	Current Rate |	Proposed Rate |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Protocol Fee |	0.022% |	0.01% |
| Vault Fee |	0.018% | 0.01% |

No other parameters, including balance incentives or governance mechanisms, are affected by this proposal.

## Rationale

* Increased Transaction Volume:

Lower transaction costs reduce barriers for users and applications, encouraging more frequent cross-chain activity.

* Improved Liquidity Utilization:

Higher transaction throughput leads to better usage of existing vault liquidity, increasing overall efficiency.

* Support for Liquidity Providers:

While per-transaction fees decrease, increased volume may compensate through higher aggregate fee generation.

* Long-Term Network Growth:

A more active network strengthens ecosystem adoption and supports sustainable MAPO token value creation.

## Impact

* Users: Lower transaction fees and improved experience

* Liquidity Providers: Higher vault activity and utilization

* Protocol: Increased on-chain activity and stronger network effects

All fee collection and distribution remain fully on-chain and transparent.

## Governance & Implementation

Upon approval, the proposed fee changes will be implemented through governance execution.

Future adjustments remain subject to MAPO DAO governance processes.

## Conclusion

Reducing both Protocol Fee and Vault Fee to 0.01% aims to enhance MAP Protocol’s competitiveness, improve liquidity efficiency, and support long-term ecosystem growth through increased network activity.

## Security Considerations

None.
